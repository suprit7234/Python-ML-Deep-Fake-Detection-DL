# Python-ML-Deep-Fake-Detection-DL
A machine learning project to detect deepfake images/videos using Convolutional Neural Networks. The system preprocesses input data, trains a deep learning model, and predicts whether the media is real or fake. The project can be extended with a web app using css-html for real-time predictions.
